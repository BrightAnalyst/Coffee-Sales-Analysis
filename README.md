**Recommendations**

Based on the insights derived from the coffee sales analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Focus Marketing Efforts on Coffee Products:**
   Given that coffee products are top-performing, consider running targeted promotions, loyalty programs, or product bundles to further boost sales.

2. **Investigate Low Sales in January, February and April:**
   Conduct a deeper review of operational or external factors that may have contributed to the drop in sales during these months. This could include stockouts, holidays, or reduced marketing activity.

3. **Seasonal Sales Strategy:**
   Explore historical trends to identify seasonal patterns and plan proactive campaigns or discounts during low-performing months.

4. **Optimize Inventory Management:**
   Use sales data to ensure that coffee and other fast-moving products are adequately stocked, especially during peak months.

5. **Revise Underperforming Products:**
   Evaluate products with consistently low sales to determine if pricing, packaging, or placement strategies need to be adjusted or if they should be discontinued.

   **Conclusion**
   
This dashboard project demonstrates how historical sales data can be transformed into strategic business insight using Power BI. It enables business owners, analysts, and marketers to understand sales drivers, plan inventory, and tailor promotions around trends.
