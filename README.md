Recommendations

Based on the insights derived from the coffee sales analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Focus Marketing Efforts on Coffee Products:**
   Given that coffee products are top-performing, consider running targeted promotions, loyalty programs, or product bundles to further boost sales.

2. **Investigate Low Sales in January, February and April:**
   Conduct a deeper review of operational or external factors that may have contributed to the drop in sales during these months. This could include stockouts, holidays, or reduced marketing activity.

3. **Seasonal Sales Strategy:**
   Explore historical trends to identify seasonal patterns and plan proactive campaigns or discounts during low-performing months.

4. **Optimize Inventory Management:**
   Use sales data to ensure that coffee and other fast-moving products are adequately stocked, especially during peak months.

5. **Revise Underperforming Products:**
   Evaluate products with consistently low sales to determine if pricing, packaging, or placement strategies need to be adjusted or if they should be discontinued.
